#+TODO: TODO IN_PROGRESS | DONE CANCELED

* TODO Replace glue code and struct packing using fsbv
I have resorted to some hackery to deal with structs passed by value
including packing structures into int64s and writing special-case glue
code. It turns out there is a library fsbv that should allow me to
handle these cases without such hackery.
* TODO Wrap highgui functions for reading and writing images. [0%]
  - [ ] cvCreateVideoWriter
  - [ ] cvReleaseVideoWriter
  - [ ] cvWriteFrame
  - [ ] CV_FOURCC
* TODO Add miscellaneous image transformations [1]. [11%]
  - [X] cvAdaptiveThreshold
  - [ ] cvCvtColor
  - [ ] cvDistTransform (?)
  - [ ] CvConnectedComp
  - [ ] cvFloodFill
  - [ ] cvInpaint
  - [ ] cvIntegral
  - [ ] cvPyrMeanShiftFiltering
  - [ ] cvPyrSegmentation
* TODO Make get capture property return proper type.
Currently all properties are returned as doubles, which forces me to
truncate them when I actually am expecting an integer. Fix this so
each property gets returned as the proper type.
* TODO Wrap cvCreateImageHeader.
* TODO Implement IplImage as a C struct accessible from Lisp.
This will allow me to directly access pixel data and other `IplImage`
information through `IplImage` pointers. This would be particularly
useful in conjunction with cvCreateImageHeader for creating a header
and then pointing the data somewhere inside an existing image.
* TODO Create with-images macro to automatically release images when done.
* TODO Create with-window macro to automatically destroy windows when done.
* TODO Figure out how to do callbacks for foreign functions in Lisp.
* TODO Figure out how to better deal with passing structs by value.
* TODO Do better error handling of foreign function exceptions.
* TODO Wrap more of the user interface functionality. [0%]
 - [ ] cvCreateTrackbar
 - [ ] cvGetTrackbarPos
 - [ ] cvGetWindowHandle (?)
 - [ ] cvGetWindowName (?)
 - [ ] cvInitSystem
 - [ ] cvSetMouseCallback
 - [ ] cvSetTrackbarPos
* IN_PROGRESS Add some simple image filters [1]. [55%]
 - [X] cvDilate
 - [X] cvErode
 - [ ] cvFilter2D
 - [X] cvLaplace
 - [ ] cvMorphologyEx
 - [X] cvPyrDown
 - [X] cvReleaseStructuringElement
 - [ ] cvSmooth
 - [ ] cvSobel
* TODO Handle custom values for create-structuring-element-ex.
The create-structuring-element-ex allows users to create their own
convolution kernel. In the C interface the values of the kernel
components are passed as an array (pointer to int). I need to add Lisp
code to handle the list of kernel values and turn these into a native array.
